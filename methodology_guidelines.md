# Methodology guidelines

## Progressive disclosure patterns

if Claude could learn from documents in progressive disclosure patterns. Some documents serves as an index that points to detailed materials as further needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide, Then The cost will be saved.

**Practical guidance:**
- Keep documents under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
- Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

### Visual overview: From simple to complex

A basic Skill starts with just a SKILL.md file containing metadata and instructions:

![Simple SKILL.md file showing YAML frontmatter and markdown body](/docs/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png)

As your Skill grows, you can bundle additional content that Claude loads only when needed:

![Bundling additional reference files like reference.md and forms.md.](/docs/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png)

The complete Skill directory structure might look like this:

```text
pdf/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions (loaded when triggered)
├── FORMS.md              # Form-filling guide (loaded as needed)
├── reference.md          # API reference (loaded as needed)
├── examples.md           # Usage examples (loaded as needed)
└── scripts/
    ├── analyze_form.py   # Utility script (executed, not loaded)
    ├── fill_form.py      # Form filling script
    └── validate.py       # Validation script
```

### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

````markdown
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## Advanced features

**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
**Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
````

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context. When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only needs to read sales-related schemas, not finance or marketing data. This keeps token usage low and context focused.

```text
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

````markdown SKILL.md
# BigQuery Data Analysis

## Available datasets

**Finance**: Revenue, ARR, billing → See [reference/finance.md](reference/finance.md)
**Sales**: Opportunities, pipeline, accounts → See [reference/sales.md](reference/sales.md)
**Product**: API usage, features, adoption → See [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
**Marketing**: Campaigns, attribution, email → See [reference/marketing.md](reference/marketing.md)

## Quick search

Find specific metrics using grep:

```bash
grep -i "revenue" reference/finance.md
grep -i "pipeline" reference/sales.md
grep -i "api usage" reference/product.md
```
````

### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

### Avoid deeply nested references

Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. When encountering nested references, Claude might use commands like `head -100` to preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information.

**Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md to ensure Claude reads complete files when needed.

**Bad example: Too deep**:
```markdown
# SKILL.md
See [advanced.md](advanced.md)...

# advanced.md
See [details.md](details.md)...

# details.md
Here's the actual information...
```

**Good example: One level deep**:
```markdown
# SKILL.md

**Basic usage**: [instructions in SKILL.md]
**Advanced features**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**API reference**: See [reference.md](reference.md)
**Examples**: See [examples.md](examples.md)
```

### Structure longer reference files with table of contents

For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top. This ensures Claude can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with partial reads.

**Example**:
```markdown
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

Claude can then read the complete file or jump to specific sections as needed.

For details on how this filesystem-based architecture enables progressive disclosure, see the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section in the Advanced section below.


## Content guidelines

### Avoid time-sensitive information

Don't include information that will become outdated:

**Bad example: Time-sensitive** (will become wrong):
```markdown
If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.
After August 2025, use the new API.
```

**Good example** (use "old patterns" section):
```markdown
## Current method

Use the v2 API endpoint: `api.example.com/v2/messages`

## Old patterns

<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>

The v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`

This endpoint is no longer supported.
</details>
```

The old patterns section provides historical context without cluttering the main content.

### Use consistent terminology

Choose one term and use it throughout all the documents:

**Good - Consistent**:
- Always "API endpoint"
- Always "field"
- Always "extract"

**Bad - Inconsistent**:
- Mix "API endpoint", "URL", "API route", "path"
- Mix "field", "box", "element", "control"
- Mix "extract", "pull", "get", "retrieve"

Consistency helps Claude understand and follow instructions.

## Evaluation and iteration

Some documents is made with purposes.比如 skills.md. 这些文档应该随着使用而不断地迭代更新。

### Build evaluations first

根据使用的目的创建一个评价的方法，当然，这个评价方法本身也可能是需要迭代更新的。我还听说过一种方法，就是将某一些文档做成 skills，然后让 skills 执行的成功与否来作为这个文档是否过时的标准。

**Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

**Evaluation-driven development:**
1. **Identify gaps**: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill. Document specific failures or missing context
2. **Create evaluations**: Build three scenarios that test these gaps
3. **Establish baseline**: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill
4. **Write minimal instructions**: Create just enough content to address the gaps and pass evaluations
5. **Iterate**: Execute evaluations, compare against baseline, and refine

This approach ensures you're solving actual problems rather than anticipating requirements that may never materialize.

**Evaluation structure**:
```json
{
  "skills": ["pdf-processing"],
  "query": "Extract all text from this PDF file and save it to output.txt",
  "files": ["test-files/document.pdf"],
  "expected_behavior": [
    "Successfully reads the PDF file using an appropriate PDF processing library or command-line tool",
    "Extracts text content from all pages in the document without missing any pages",
    "Saves the extracted text to a file named output.txt in a clear, readable format"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
This example demonstrates a data-driven evaluation with a simple testing rubric. There is not currently a built-in way to run these evaluations. Users can create their own evaluation system. Evaluations are your source of truth for measuring Skill effectiveness.
</Note>

### Develop Skills iteratively with Claude

The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances ("Claude B"). Claude A helps you design and refine instructions, while Claude B tests them in real tasks. This works because Claude models understand both how to write effective agent instructions and what information agents need.

**Creating a new Skill:**

1. **Complete a task without a Skill**: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal prompting. As you work, you'll naturally provide context, explain preferences, and share procedural knowledge. Notice what information you repeatedly provide.

2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: After completing the task, identify what context you provided that would be useful for similar future tasks.

   **Example**: If you worked through a BigQuery analysis, you might have provided table names, field definitions, filtering rules (like "always exclude test accounts"), and common query patterns.

3. **Ask Claude A to create a Skill**: "Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis pattern we just used. Include the table schemas, naming conventions, and the rule about filtering test accounts."

   <Tip>
   Claude models understand the Skill format and structure natively. You don't need special system prompts or a "writing skills" skill to get Claude to help create Skills. Simply ask Claude to create a Skill and it will generate properly structured SKILL.md content with appropriate frontmatter and body content.
   </Tip>

4. **Review for conciseness**: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary explanations. Ask: "Remove the explanation about what win rate means - Claude already knows that."

5. **Improve information architecture**: Ask Claude A to organize the content more effectively. For example: "Organize this so the table schema is in a separate reference file. We might add more tables later."

6. **Test on similar tasks**: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance with the Skill loaded) on related use cases. Observe whether Claude B finds the right information, applies rules correctly, and handles the task successfully.

7. **Iterate based on observation**: If Claude B struggles or misses something, return to Claude A with specifics: "When Claude used this Skill, it forgot to filter by date for Q4. Should we add a section about date filtering patterns?"

**Iterating on existing Skills:**

The same hierarchical pattern continues when improving Skills. You alternate between:
- **Working with Claude A** (the expert who helps refine the Skill)
- **Testing with Claude B** (the agent using the Skill to perform real work)
- **Observing Claude B's behavior** and bringing insights back to Claude A

1. **Use the Skill in real workflows**: Give Claude B (with the Skill loaded) actual tasks, not test scenarios

2. **Observe Claude B's behavior**: Note where it struggles, succeeds, or makes unexpected choices

   **Example observation**: "When I asked Claude B for a regional sales report, it wrote the query but forgot to filter out test accounts, even though the Skill mentions this rule."

3. **Return to Claude A for improvements**: Share the current SKILL.md and describe what you observed. Ask: "I noticed Claude B forgot to filter test accounts when I asked for a regional report. The Skill mentions filtering, but maybe it's not prominent enough?"

4. **Review Claude A's suggestions**: Claude A might suggest reorganizing to make rules more prominent, using stronger language like "MUST filter" instead of "always filter", or restructuring the workflow section.

5. **Apply and test changes**: Update the Skill with Claude A's refinements, then test again with Claude B on similar requests

6. **Repeat based on usage**: Continue this observe-refine-test cycle as you encounter new scenarios. Each iteration improves the Skill based on real agent behavior, not assumptions.

**Gathering team feedback:**

1. Share Skills with teammates and observe their usage
2. Ask: Does the Skill activate when expected? Are instructions clear? What's missing?
3. Incorporate feedback to address blind spots in your own usage patterns

**Why this approach works**: Claude A understands agent needs, you provide domain expertise, Claude B reveals gaps through real usage, and iterative refinement improves Skills based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

### Observe how Claude navigates Skills

As you iterate on Skills, pay attention to how Claude actually uses them in practice. Watch for:

- **Unexpected exploration paths**: Does Claude read files in an order you didn't anticipate? This might indicate your structure isn't as intuitive as you thought
- **Missed connections**: Does Claude fail to follow references to important files? Your links might need to be more explicit or prominent
- **Overreliance on certain sections**: If Claude repeatedly reads the same file, consider whether that content should be in the main SKILL.md instead
- **Ignored content**: If Claude never accesses a bundled file, it might be unnecessary or poorly signaled in the main instructions

Iterate based on these observations rather than assumptions. The 'name' and 'description' in your Skill's metadata are particularly critical. Claude uses these when deciding whether to trigger the Skill in response to the current task. Make sure they clearly describe what the Skill does and when it should be used.
