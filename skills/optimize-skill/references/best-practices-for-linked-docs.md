## Template files pattern

Provide templates for output format. Match the level of strictness to your needs.

**For strict requirements** (like API responses or data formats):

````markdown
## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
```
````

**For flexible guidance** (when adaptation is useful):

````markdown
## Report structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment based on the analysis:

```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[Overview]

## Key findings
[Adapt sections based on what you discover]

## Recommendations
[Tailor to the specific context]
```

Adjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.
````

## Example files pattern

For Skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs just like in regular prompting:

````markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
```

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
```
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
```

**Example 3:**
Input: Updated dependencies and refactored error handling
Output:
```
chore: update dependencies and refactor error handling

- Upgrade lodash to 4.17.21
- Standardize error response format across endpoints
```

Follow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.
````

Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone.
